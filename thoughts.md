2 takeaways:
-I need to do some of my on research outside of class to fully understand how to use git, github, atom, etc.
-it is better to go through the curriculum and take notes before class, rather than during.


2 new strategies:
-Id like to start following along using the lesson slides, rather than my current method of trying to follow along using the actual lesson page
-begin going over vocabulary from past lessons and record them in my vocab notebook.
