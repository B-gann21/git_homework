2 takeaways:
-I need to do some of my on research outside of class to fully understand how to use git, github, atom, etc.
-it is better to go through the curriculum and take notes before class, rather than during.

2 new strategies:
-Id like to start following along using the lesson slides, rather than my current method of trying to follow along using the actual lesson page
-begin going over vocabulary from past lessons and record them in my vocab notebook.

Shoutout:
-Big shoutout to my old manager Lori at DBG. She has been very supportive of my decision to go to school full time instead of continue to work for her. While their custodial team is very short staffed now, it was great to see that Lori and the whole team were happy for me, rather than resentful to me for leaving.

I am pretty darn hungry.

Wish i had some tasty food.

I have mexican food in the fridge
My guinea pigs are also hungry
